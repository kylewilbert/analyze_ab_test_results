# analyze_ab_test_results
A guided analysis of A/B test results, from Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. This notebook allowed me to apply statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing and statistical techniques such as bootstrapping using Python. This was part of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

For this project, we work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Methods Used
- hypothesis testing
- bootstrapping

### Technologies
- Python
    - Pandas
